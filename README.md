## Introduction

The stock market is arguably the first big data problem, and has drawn investors, academics, and novices alike for hundreds of years. Today it’s easier than ever before to both analyze the stock market and play your hand in it as an investor. However, despite the sheer number of minds and resources invested into “solving the stock market” its unclear if the efficient market hypothesis can ever truly be beaten in the long run.

A famous statement from economist Burton Malkiel’s book A Random Walk Down Wall Street states “A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.” 

This project aims to step into the monkey’s shoes, and find out how true Malkiel’s statement is in the modern investing environment.
